7. Function overloading allows similar operations to be performed on different data types
   ie. by calling functions with the same name which multiply two numbers, you are able
   to use the same function name regardless of the type of the argument

10. a) keyword 'class' or keyword 'typename' are not present before the first use of variable 'T'
       - first line should be template <class A>
    b) The stream extraction operator is being used in place of the stream insertion operator
       - change >> to <<
    c) variable T should replace all instances of int in the template
       - change occurances of 'int' to 'T'
    d) If the intent was to create two overloaded functions, one to process int's and one
       to process double's, then the argument of the first overloaded function is incorrect
       - change 'int' to 'double' on the first line
