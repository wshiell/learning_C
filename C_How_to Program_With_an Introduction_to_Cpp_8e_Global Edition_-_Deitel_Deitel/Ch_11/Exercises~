6. a) True.
   b) False. Characters are designed to be readable by humans more readily than are bits. So people
      prefer to manipulate characters.
   c) True.
   d) True.
   e) False. Data items become smaller and simpler as you progress from fields to characters to bits.
   f) False. A record key allows a program to locate the position of a record in a random-access file.
   g) False. Storing data in a single file is a bad idea for many reasons. It is not a safe way to store
      data (the file could be lost or corrupted, and all the company's data would then be done), and it
      is not a very efficient way to store the data, as not all the data in the file might be needed
      most of the time.
   h) False. Files are referred to by a file pointer, which points to the file structure associated with
      the file.
   i) True.
