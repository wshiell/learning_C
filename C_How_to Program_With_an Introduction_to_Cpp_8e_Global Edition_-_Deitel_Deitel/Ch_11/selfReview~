1. a) fclose()
   b) fscanf()
   c) fgetc()
   d) fputs() XX WRONG fgets()
   e) fopen()
   f) fread()
   g) fseek()

2. a) False. You can use fscanf() to read data from the standard input by using stdin as the first
      argument
   b) False. fopen() is only used to open standard input when it uses a FILE structure as a stream
   c) False. A file will be closed by the operating system if fclose() is not called, but it is
      recommended that fclose() be used
   d) False. Function rewind() can be used to go back to the beginning of the file (or function fseek())
   e) True.
   f) False. If a sequential access file is updated, data after the point at which the update occurs
      may be overwritten
   g) True.
   h) False. Records in a random access file are all of the same length (determined by using the sizeof()
      operator in conjunction with the object being stored in the file)
   i) False. fseek() may seek relative to the beginning, end or current position in a file using
      SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR or SEEK_END.

3. a) ofPtr = fopen("oldmast.dat", "r");
   b) tfPtr = fopen("trans.dat", "r");
   c) nfPtr = fopen("newmast.dat", "w");
   d) fread(&accountNum, name, &currentBalance, sizeof(), ofPtr);
      XX WRONG fread(ofPtr, "%d%s%lf", &accountNum, name, &currentBalance);
   e) fread( &accountNum, &dollarAmount, sizeof(), tfPtr);
   XX WRONG fread(tfPtr, "%d%f", &accountNum, &dollarAmount);
   f) fwrite(&accountNum, name, &currentBalance, sizeof(), nfPtr);
   XX WRONG
      fwrite(nfPtr, "%d %s %lf", accountNum, name, balance);

4. a) Because the file "payables.dat" has not been opened, referencing it in the program will cause
      errors. To correct this, add the statement
      fopen("payables.dat", "r");
      at the start of the program
   b) The funnction open() does not exist. Use fopen()
   c) scanf() is being used, but fscanf() should be used instead. Also, the wrong pointer is being used,
      payPtr should be used to refer to the correct file.
   d) The write mode "w" is being used, which will discard all data in the file. Use "r+" instead.
   e) The write mode "w+" is being used, which will create a new file for reading and updating, *or*
      discard the data in the current file. Use "a" instead
