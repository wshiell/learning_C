1. a) definite
   b) indefinite
   c) counter
   d) continue
   e) break
   f) continuation condition X SWITCH SELECTION STATEMENT

2. a) false. If it is not included, the program will just
      continue
      after the switch statement
   b) false. Providing the default case is included at the end
      of the switch, the program will continue after the switch
      whether a break statement is included or not
   c) false. It is true only if both operands are true
   d) true.

4. a) - missing left brace after condition/semi-colon after
        condition: remove semi-colon, add left brace.
   b) - using a floating point value in an equality statement
        (floating point values should not be used in equality
	or relational statements): change to an integer value.
   c) - break statement missing after first case; actions for
        the first two cases will execute if case 1 is true:
	add break statement.
   d) - n is never equal to 10 in the conditional, so the while
        loop will never print the number 10: change to n <= 10.
