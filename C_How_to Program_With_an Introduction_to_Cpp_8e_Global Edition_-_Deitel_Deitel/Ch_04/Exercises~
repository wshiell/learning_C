5. a) - incrementation variable not declared (should be type int
        or unsigned int)
   b) - missing break statement for first case, so the switch
        statement will print "Even integer" as well as "Odd
        integer" regardless of whether an integer is even or odd
   c) - variable salary not initialised outside of loop
      - variable year will only be available inside loop, so
        the printf statement will not have access to it
      - variable year should be declared unsigned
   d) - missing braces (not technically wrong)
      - using type double in a condition is incorrect;
        should change statement so as to eliminate floating
	point numbers in the for header
   e) - x % 3 == 0 should not be in the for header, it should
        be included in the loop body
	ie.
	   if ( x % 3 == 0) {
	     printf("%d ", x);
           }
	   else {
             printf("");
           }
